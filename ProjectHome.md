This game is a wild-west text adventure (["interactive fiction"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)) originally written for the [Casual Gameplay One-Room Escape Game](http://jayisgames.com/archives/2009/11/game_design_competition_7.php) competition.

It's written in the [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) programming language, and compiles into bytecode that can be executed on a [Z-machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) interpreter.

(Because the source text straddles the fuzzy line between "code" and "fiction", we've released it on the Creative Commons Attribution - Noncommercial - Share Alike 3.0 license.)

## To play the game OFFLINE ##

  1. Grab the latest .zblorb (or .z8) file from the Download bubble to the right.
  1. Grab a nice interpreter to play the game:  either [Zoom](http://www.logicalshift.co.uk/mac/Zoom-1.1.4.dmg) for Mac, [WinFrotz](http://ifarchive.plover.net/if-archive/infocom/interpreters/frotz/WindowsFrotz2002.zip) for Windows, or [Gargoyle](http://ifarchive.flavorplex.com/indexes/if-archiveXinterpreters-multiXgargoyle.html) for Linux.  There are also interpreters out there for iPhone ("Frotz" in the AppStore), Android Phone ("Twisty" in the Market), and other esoteric platforms as well.
  1. Load the game into the interpreter to play.


_If you've never played interactive fiction before_:  read this simple [crib sheet](http://www.microheaven.com/IFGuide/step3.html) to give you a sense of how the command parser works.  It's a limited vocabulary, fairly easy to master.


## To modify or compile the game ##

Clone the mercurial repository using the instructions on the Source tab.  Read the README file for further instructions.  Of course, we recommend you play the game first, unless you want spoilers.  :-)
