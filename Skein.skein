As the sun sets on the plains, the sheriff angrily snaps on the cuffs. You are shoved into the coach and land on top of Muddy Charlie and the pile of silver dollars, which until recently had been the property of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Line.

Muddy furtively whispers, &quot;Hang tight, Rick! You done good blowing up that tunnel -- I just didn&apos;t plan on the sheriff getting word ahead of time, is all. That were powerful bad luck.&quot;

The sheriff climbs onto his horse, spits, and you begin to rumble forward. &quot;You boys really got it coming this time,&quot; he yells back cheerfully.

Muddy shakes his head. &quot;No offense, Sheriff, but I reckon you got the wrong men. We was just on our way to the theater.&quot;

The sheriff disagrees. &quot;The only place you boys are heading is straight to the...

You land awkwardly in the rutted street, where the sheriff holds you in place with the heel of one boot. He yells to his men, &quot;Bring the coach on around, we got to impound that evidence.&quot; You are manhandled into the sheriff&apos;s office and shoved into a small holding cell.

The deputy wakes with a start, whips his dusty boots off the desk and stands, tucking his shirt back into his pants. The sheriff gives him a brief, judgmental glance and offhandedly tosses an arrest warrant on the desk. He barks, &quot;Jimbo, listen up. Picked up these two down near the train. A federal marshal will be coming for them at eight o&apos;clock tomorrow morning. There&apos;s going to be a hanging!&quot;. The deputy nods slowly. The sheriff continues, &quot;Please take care of our &apos;guests&apos;. I got to head down to Wichita Falls to discuss my invention with some investors, so you is in charge.&quot; The deputy smiles until the sheriff adds, &quot;Jimbo, don&apos;t screw up,&quot; as he heads out the door.

Jail Cell
Why are you not surprised to have landed right back in the hoosegow after another one of Muddy&apos;s dubious plans? Will you ever learn? You weren&apos;t brought up for this sort of life -- how did it come to this? 

The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate.  A small window is set into the brickwork above your head.  Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A broken stool lies on the floor.

In the corner of the cell, Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by, and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the door way, tempted by the dinner bell.

The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog&apos;s bowl and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office&apos;s strange looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

&quot;This here&apos;s Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don&apos;t cross him.&quot; Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can hear that half way across town, and if&apos;n I do hear it, then you&apos;ll have to deal with me *and* Flash.&quot; The deputy gives Flash one last pat on the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon.

The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate.  A small window is set into the brickwork above your head.  Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

The ameoba-like mass of fat and fur known to you as Flash leaps immediately to his feet, saliva dripping from his toothless jowls. He lunges like a champion fencer for his food bowl. His leash snaps taut, pulling the lever away from the front door and towards the strange machine.

The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee pervades the office.

Finding no food in his bowl, Flash huffs perfunctorily and resumes his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

Jail Cell
The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate.  A small window is set into the brickwork above your head.  Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A repaired stool stands upright.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon) here.

In the office you can see a deputy.

Sheridan of Fort Sill, the Indian Territory of these United States of America. The fugitives Mudlark Abercromby MacGyver alias &quot;Muddy,&quot; alias &quot;Mudshoe,&quot; alias &quot;Pensicola Thelma,&quot; and one Major Richard Carter, alias &quot;Gentleman Rick,&quot; alias &quot;Poor Richard,&quot; alias &quot;Gumball Ricky,&quot; both formerly of the Confederate States Army, having been implicated by observation and circumstance of innumerable delicta, dacoiteries, iniquities, infringements, infractions, and indeed immorality, as well as trangressions, trespassing and trainstopping, are considered deleterious and detrimental to the welfare of the State, and THEREFORE, ordered thereupon that a Mittimus be made out to keep them confined until such time as they be discharged for proper hanging -- It&apos;s signed by the General.&quot;

&quot;Mittimus?&quot;

&quot;I reckon it&apos;s after Thanksgiving, before Easter.&quot;


Muddy gives you that familiar old look that always leads to trouble. &quot;I got me another cunning plan. C&apos;mon, ask your old buddy Muddy...&quot; Muddy leans forward, clearly impatient for you to ask him about his latest stroke of (in his opinion) genius.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah. I suppose. I didn&apos;t think of that.&quot; Muddy considers the matter. &quot;Maybe we could make one. If you can find something that I can use as a pen, I reckon that one of them red berries would make a right proper kind of ink for it.&quot;

His half-focused eyes drift from you to Pastor Pete and finally fix on Muddy who gives him a full-toothed (as many as Muddy still has, at any rate) grin.

The disoriented deputy asks, &quot;What? What in tarnation happened?&quot;

Muddy takes the initiative, &quot;I reckon you must&apos;ve drunk some potent firewater, deputy. You plumb passed out. Now, why don&apos;t you get up and let us out, we got work to do -- just like it says on that federal warrant.&quot;

The dull-witted deputy, still stunned by the recent turn of events stares at the warrant.

Muddy leans forward and points out, &quot;Down there, near the bottom. It says that we should be discharged to hang up the sheriff&apos;s portrait, don&apos;t it?&quot;

The deputy yawns and rubs his eyes, &quot;I reckon it do. But I thought you was criminals.&quot;

&quot;Oh shucks, no, deputy.&quot; Muddy puts on his most endearing smile. &quot;Don&apos;t you remember the sheriff asking you to take care of his guests? We were just staying here overnight. Now, why don&apos;t you let us out? The sheriff&apos;s going to be mad at us all if that picture ain&apos;t hung by morning.&quot;

The deputy reaches down and does something arcane to the lock. You don&apos;t quite see what he did, but it clicks open. He slumps wearily against the jail bars and the gate swings open, permitting passage eastward into the office.

Office
A one room jailhouse is fitting for this jerkwater town. There&apos;s a big, wooden desk in the middle of the room, and behind it sits the deputy. Just behind the desk is a fancy cabinet, with real glass in the door. Next to the cabinet, a large, framed picture of the sheriff stands on the floor. To the side of the desk, there is a weird looking contraption: clearly, some sort of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a strange looking machine. On the opposite side of the room, two swinging doors lead back to town. Flash&apos;s empty dog food bowl is nailed to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

Muddy leans against the wall.

You can also see a deputy here.

A repaired stool stands upright.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

In the jail cell you can also see a harmonica and a can of beans (in which is a spoon).

There&apos;s a big, wooden desk in the middle of the room, and behind it sits the deputy. Just behind the desk is a fancy cabinet, with real glass in the door. Next to the cabinet, a large, framed picture of the sheriff stands on the floor. To the side of the desk, there is a weird looking contraption: clearly, some sort of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a strange looking machine. On the opposite side of the room, two swinging doors lead back to town. Flash&apos;s empty dog food bowl is nailed to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

Muddy leans against the wall.

You can also see a deputy here.

A repaired stool stands upright.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

In the jail cell you can also see a harmonica and a can of beans (in which is a spoon).

As you head out of the office, two men appear in the door way: Sheriff Cheney and Federal Marshal McLuhan. They are followed by a small detachment of U.S. Army guards.

Sheriff Cheney surges forward pointing his finger at you and Muddy, &quot;It were these two what blown up that train tunnel! They&apos;s escaping when we walked in! Look, they done killed my deputy! We should drop &apos;em where they stand.&quot;

The marshal looks uncertain and waves the army guards forward, training their pistols on you. 

He rests his hand on the sheriff&apos;s trigger arm and says, &quot;Sheriff, without any evidence to substantiate your accusation regarding the train robbery, I was reluctant to see these men hanged without a trial.

&quot;Well sure, mister marshal, sir. The sheriff done told me they was our welcome guests and that he wanted his picture hung up.&quot;

The marshal raises his eyebrows suspiciously, &quot;You had federal suspects tidying up your office? Sheriff Cheney, I have to say that seems quite sloppy, and not in keeping with the public trust inherent in your position.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot; he asks. &quot;It seems like a clever enough invention, and I presume this work was not done on public time, or using town resources. I also would guess that he will need some big-time investors to put a plan like this into action, but I don&apos;t see anything wrong with that. The sheriff&apos;s a businessman pure and simple. There isn&apos;t anything more American than a man willing to make a profit, when the profit is there for the taking.&quot;

The marshal advises, &quot;Citizens, I am required by federal law as it applies to the Territory to advise you that CAPITAL CHARGES have been filed against you, and summary execution will take place, unless evidence to the contrary can be brought to light.&quot;

The sheriff rolls his eyes, &quot;For the sake of the all that&apos;s Holy, whyn&apos;t we shoot &apos;em dead right here?&quot;

Can you show me any additional evidence that would corroborate this grave accusation? I&apos;m not inclined to distrust an officer of the law.

The sheriff took advantage of the railway incident to rob the train&apos;s silver himself in order to finance the development of his invention into a business. He framed these two itinerant laborers to shift the blame. No wonder he wanted them killed so quickly.&quot;

The marshal rips the gold star off the Sheriff Cheney&apos;s shirt and instructs the guards, &quot;Place Mr. Cheney behind bars.&quot;

Pastor Pete yawns and walks out of the cell as the guards wrestle the sheriff past him. &quot;I do reckon I slept like the dead last night. Thank you for a peaceful night, deputy,&quot; and he walks out the front door.

The marshal raises his eyebrows, but continues, &quot;Deputy James Smith Bush, by the power invested in me as federal marshal of this district, I hereby promote you to Sheriff of the Town of Crawdad&apos;s Gulch. Congratulations.&quot; The newly appointed sheriff grins and shakes his hand. As the marshal pins the star on Jimbo&apos;s chest he advises, &quot;James, you&apos;ll probably want to get yourself some deputies -- men you can trust.&quot;

Sheriff Jim looks over to you and Muddy. The color drains from Muddy&apos;s face.

Upon each head, twelve horns, like that of the ram, the bull, and the elephant, say four of each. And upon each horn, sixteen stalks, not unlike celery in some respects, yet more flexible, more like the arms of an octopus, except being twice as numerous. And upon each stalk, eighty eyes, or forty pairs of eyes, if you prefer!&quot;

The ameoba-like mass of fat and fur known to you as Flash leaps immediately to his feet, saliva dripping from his toothless jowls. He lunges like a champion fencer for his food bowl. His leash snaps taut, pulling the lever away from the front door and towards the strange machine.

The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee pervades the office.

Finding no food in his bowl, Flash huffs perfunctorily and resumes his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by, and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the door way, tempted by the dinner bell.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof.
