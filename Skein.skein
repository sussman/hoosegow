As the sun sets on the plains, Sheriff Cheney angrily snaps on the cuffs. You are shoved into the coach and land on top of Muddy Charlie and a pile of  silver dollars, which until recently had been the property of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Line.

Muddy whispers, &quot;Don&apos;t fret none, Rick! You done good blowing up that tunnel -- I just didn&apos;t plan on the sheriff getting word ahead of time, is all. That were powerful bad luck.&quot;

The sheriff climbs onto his horse, spits, and you begin to rumble forward. &quot;You boys really got it coming this time,&quot; he yells back cheerfully.

Muddy shakes his head. &quot;No offense, Sheriff, but I reckon you got the wrong men. We was just on our way to the theater.&quot;

The sheriff disagrees. &quot;The only place you boys are heading is straight to the...

You land awkwardly in the rutted street, where the sheriff holds you in place with the heel of one boot. He yells to his men, &quot;Bring the coach around back, we got to impound that evidence.&quot; You are shoved into the sheriff&apos;s office and then into a small holding cell.

The deputy wakes with a start, whips his dusty boots off the desk and stands, tucking his shirt back into his pants. The sheriff gives him a brief, judgmental glance and offhandedly tosses an arrest warrant on the desk. He barks, &quot;Jimbo, listen up. Picked up these two down near the train.

Jail Cell
Why are you not surprised to have landed right back in the hoosegow after another one of Muddy&apos;s dubious plans? Will you ever learn? You weren&apos;t brought up for this sort of life -- how did it come to this? 

The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A broken stool lies on the floor.

Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You sit down on the precariously balanced two-legged stool and subsequently find yourself face down on the dusty jail floor. Muddy helps you up and brushes you off. 

The deputy laughs himself hoarse. &quot;I declare, that were powerful entertaining!&quot; The deputy continues to chuckle to himself, even as he turns back to his newspaper, &quot;I said, please go ahead, and he sits on it. That were rich. Maybe he&apos;ll try again.&quot;

In the office, the deputy peeks through the jail cell window at the saloon across the street. It&apos;s clear he&apos;d rather be there.

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the door way, tempted by the dinner bell.

The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog&apos;s bowl and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office&apos;s strange looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

&quot;This here&apos;s Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don&apos;t cross him.&quot; Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can hear that half way across town, and if&apos;n I do hear it, then you&apos;ll have to deal with me *and* Flash.&quot; The deputy gives Flash one last pat on the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon.

Muddy doubles over, &quot;Rick, you should get to high ground. I&apos;m feeling a mite bloated after them beans, and I think you know what&apos;s coming!&quot;

&quot;Where the Sam Hill do you think I&apos;m going to run to, Muddy? We&apos;re locked up in a hoosegow! Deputy, if&apos;n I was you, I would put some distance between Muddy and your nose. &quot;

The Deputy looks concerned, but confused.

Suppressing the urge to throw up from the smell, the deputy reaches over to the whiskey bottle and half drains it on his way out the door.

The fragrance gradually improves as the universe cools.
[Your score has just gone up by one]

&quot;Truthful, Rick,&quot; whispers Muddy solemnly, &quot;this ain&apos;t like all my other plans, this one is iron-clad. Ask me about it. Go ahead.&quot;

Muddy vibrates with excitement and gushes, &quot;I got to tell you, Rick, or this new plan of mine is going to drive me plumb crazy!&quot; 

&quot;Let&apos;s keep this between us, though&quot;, he whispers.

He notices the sleeping man in your cell for the first time. &quot;Don&apos;t know about him.&quot; Muddy jerks his thumb towards the sleeping figure. &quot;Might be a spy.&quot;

Muddy leans towards you, his face barely an inch from your ear and his buzzard-worthy breath even less so from your nose. &quot;Okay, Rick, I&apos;m a-going to tell my plan.&quot; Muddy pauses dramatically. &quot;Here it is: we got to break out of this jail before we get strunged up.&quot;

&quot;That&apos;s it? That&apos;s your whole damn plan? That don&apos;t count as no plan!&quot; you fume.

&quot;Keep it down, Rick!&quot; Muddy&apos;s gaze darts between the deputy and your third cellmate. &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s it for now. It takes time to cook up a good plan. You need lots of ingredients.&quot;

&quot;Muddy Charlie,&quot; you retort, &quot;I heared you was the worst cook in the Confederate Army. Your cooking like as did more damage than Sherman&apos;s March.&quot;

Muddy gives you a hurt look and sulks in the corner. After a while, you regret being so quick-tempered with your old buddy.

A fly buzzes past your ear and lands on the ceiling.

The deputy pokes his head back in the office and remarks, &quot;I&apos;ve about had enough of you characters. You can stew in your own juices here. I got important things to do over yonder in the saloon. But I reckon I would be dairy licked to leave you jokers alone.&quot;

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the door way, tempted by the dinner bell.

The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog&apos;s bowl and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office&apos;s strange looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

&quot;This here&apos;s Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don&apos;t cross him.&quot; Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can hear that half way across town, and if&apos;n I do hear it, then you&apos;ll have to deal with me *and* Flash.&quot; The deputy gives Flash one last pat on the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon.

Jail Cell
The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A broken stool lies on the floor.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon) and a hunk of meat here.

Jail Cell (on the stool)
The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon) and a hunk of meat here.

The ameoba-like mass of fat and fur known to you as Flash leaps immediately to his feet, saliva dripping from his toothless jowls. He lunges like a champion fencer for his food bowl. His leash snaps taut, pulling the lever away from the front door and towards the strange machine.

The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee pervades the office.

Finding no food in his bowl, Flash huffs perfunctorily and resumes his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

To which you reply, &quot;Not after I been downwind of you around feeding time, nope. This ain&apos;t nothing next to what you can do with a can of beans!&quot;

Flash wakes with a start and sneezes loudly. The fur on his back bristles and he opens his eyes to stare in horror at your feet. He backs away, towards the front door. The leash pulls taut.

Muddy&apos;s eyes water as he complains, &quot;Not again! My poor nose!&quot;

One foot was bad enough, but two is more than the old dog can handle. Trying not to sniff the air, flash turns tail and breaks for the door, straining against his leash which is tied to the steam pipe lever. The lever swings towards the door, and from the roof you hear the ear-splitting drone of a railway steam whistle.

You agree with with Muddy that the deputy is not likely to be in a good mood when he arrives, so you put your boots back on.

The Deputy slams through the swinging doors to the office, lurching to the side as he struggles to put his other leg into his pants. He is bare-chested and empty handed, aside from a nearly empty bottle of whiskey.

The deputy thunders, &quot;What the cluster chucking blazes is the matter here?&quot; The deputy surveys the office quickly and then rattles the gate to make sure it is still locked. In his drunk rage, he doesn&apos;t notice the missing metal bar. 

Satisfied that you haven&apos;t escaped, he pushes the lever back to the middle position and warns, &quot;I don&apos;t know what you were up to what made old Flash trigger-happy, but don&apos;t let it happen again.&quot;&quot;Dumb dog,&quot; he mumbles, &quot;I was doing important business.&quot; The deputy waves his fist at you and leaves the office.

The deputy brightens. &quot;Ummm. I do smell me some coffee.&quot; The deputy drains the mug with a single gulp. &quot;That&apos;s good. I got to wake me up some.&quot;

The deputy looks at the two of you.  &quot;Enough is enough.  You jokers stay put, I&apos;ll be back again in a bit.&quot;

The deputy watches Flash slink back into the office before sauntering out again.

The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon) and a hunk of meat here.

On the machine is a cup (in which are a cup of coffee).

In the office you can also see Flash.

Flash wakes with a start and sneezes loudly. The fur on his back bristles and he opens his eyes to stare in horror at your feet. He backs away, towards the front door. The leash pulls taut. He seems caught in the balance between an urge to run away from your stinky foot and his own laziness which holds him to the spot.

One foot was bad enough, but two is more than the old dog can handle. Trying not to sniff the air, flash turns tail and breaks for the door, straining against his leash which is tied to the steam pipe lever. The lever swings towards the door, and from the roof you hear the ear-splitting drone of a railway steam whistle.

You agree with with Muddy that the deputy is not likely to be in a good mood when he arrives, so you put your boots back on.

The Deputy slams through the swinging doors to the office, lurching to the side as he struggles to put his other leg into his pants. He is bare-chested and empty handed, aside from a nearly empty bottle of whiskey. Flash is so scared that yanks the leash and snaps the lever clear off the machine.

The deputy thunders, &quot;What the cow-poking sheep-sheering bear-baiting turkey-trotting blazes is the matter here?&quot; The deputy surveys the office quickly and then rattles the gate to make sure it is still locked. In his drunk rage, he doesn&apos;t notice the missing metal bar. 

&quot;Dumb dog,&quot; he mumbles, &quot;I was doing important business.&quot; He looks around for Flash, but the dog has already slid out of the office. The deputy checks the gate again and leaves the office.

The deputy brightens. &quot;Ummm. I do smell me some coffee.&quot; The deputy drains the mug with a single gulp. &quot;That&apos;s good. I got to wake me up some.&quot;

Almost immediately, the deputy spins on his heel and drops to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

The disoriented deputy asks, &quot;What? What in tarnation happened?&quot;

Muddy takes the initiative, &quot;I reckon you must&apos;ve drunk some potent firewater, deputy. You plumb passed out. Now, why don&apos;t you get up and let us out, we got work to do -- just like it says on that federal warrant.&quot;

The dull-witted deputy, still stunned by the recent turn of events stares at the warrant.

Muddy leans forward and points out, &quot;Down there, near the bottom. It says that we should be discharged to hang up the sheriff&apos;s portrait, don&apos;t it?&quot;

The deputy yawns and rubs his eyes, &quot;I reckon it do. But I thought you was criminals.&quot;

&quot;Oh shucks, no, deputy.&quot; Muddy puts on his most endearing smile. &quot;Don&apos;t you remember the sheriff asking you to take care of his guests? We were just staying here overnight. Now, why don&apos;t you let us out? The sheriff&apos;s going to be mad at us all if that picture ain&apos;t hung by morning.&quot;

The deputy reaches down and does something arcane to the lock. You don&apos;t quite see what he did, but it clicks open. He slumps wearily against the jail bars and the gate swings open, permitting passage eastward into the office.

Office
A one room jailhouse is fitting for this jerkwater town. There&apos;s a big, wooden desk in the middle of the room, and behind it sits the deputy. Just behind the desk is a fancy cabinet, with real glass in the door. Next to the cabinet, a large, framed picture of the sheriff stands on the floor. To the side of the desk, there is a weird looking contraption: clearly, some sort of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a strange looking machine. On the opposite side of the room, two swinging doors lead back to town. Flash&apos;s empty dog food bowl is nailed to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

Muddy leans against the wall.

You can also see a deputy here.

A repaired stool stands upright.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

In the jail cell you can also see a harmonica and a can of beans (in which is a spoon).

As you head out of the office, two men appear in the door way: Sheriff Cheney and Federal Marshal McLuhan. They are followed by a small detachment of U.S. Army guards.

Sheriff Cheney surges forward pointing his finger at you and Muddy, &quot;It were these two what blown up that train tunnel! They&apos;s escaping when we walked in! Look, they done killed my deputy! We should drop &apos;em where they stand.&quot;

The marshal looks uncertain and waves the army guards forward, training their pistols on you. 

He rests his hand on the sheriff&apos;s trigger arm and says, &quot;Sheriff, without any evidence to substantiate your accusation regarding the train robbery, I was reluctant to see these men hanged without a trial. Given the corpse of a lawman in front of us, though, even I have to agree that justice should be swift and definitive in this instance.&quot;

The marshal strokes his chin. &quot;You&apos;re saying that the sheriff intended to abscond with these funds instead of turning them to state&apos;s evidence? Can you show me any additional evidence that would corroborate this grave accusation? I&apos;m not inclined to distrust an officer of the law. It is true that the sheriff had some personal business concerns, but I have seen nothing to make me suspect that he was lacking for funds.&quot;

Sheriff Cheney walks behind the office desk and is alarmed to see that the drawer has been unlocked.

The marshal looks disappointed and says, &quot;Being in debt is no crime, although it does eat away at the soul. Once, I went an entire week owing more then five dollars, and I regret it to this day. However, there is nothing to suggest that the sheriff had any sort of plan that would have required this much money.&quot;

An excited looking army guard burst into the room and tells the marshal, &quot;We just found a whole wagon of silver around the back of the jail. Looks like it was stolen from that train.&quot;

You show the patent to marshal, and intimate that the sheriff had extensive business plans, far beyond his his mandate as a public servant. 

Marshal McLuhan instructs his guards to restrain and disarm the sheriff, concluding, &quot;So, now it is clear. The sheriff took advantage of the railway incident to rob the train&apos;s silver himself in order to finance the development of his invention into a business. He framed these two itinerant laborers to shift the blame. No wonder he wanted them killed so quickly.&quot;

The marshal rips the gold star off the Sheriff Cheney&apos;s shirt and instructs the guards, &quot;Place Mr. Cheney behind bars.&quot;

Pastor Pete yawns and walks out of the cell as the guards wrestle the sheriff past him. &quot;I do reckon I slept like the dead last night. Thank you for a peaceful night, deputy,&quot; and he walks out the front door.

The marshal raises his eyebrows, but continues, &quot;Deputy James Smith Bush, by the power invested in me as federal marshal of this district, I hereby promote you to Sheriff of the Town of Crawdad&apos;s Gulch. Congratulations.&quot; The newly appointed sheriff grins and shakes his hand. As the marshal pins the star on Jimbo&apos;s chest he advises, &quot;James, you&apos;ll probably want to get yourself some deputies -- men you can trust.&quot;

Sheriff Jim looks over to you and Muddy. The color drains from Muddy&apos;s face.
[Your score has just gone up by five]

The sheriff searches the office in vain for the federal warrant for your arrest, and not finding it, sends a guard to fetch a copy from the telegraph office. He continues to search, though, as if looking for some other papers.

Office
A one room jailhouse is fitting for this jerkwater town. There&apos;s a big, wooden desk in the middle of the room, and behind it sits the deputy. Just behind the desk is a fancy cabinet, with real glass in the door. Next to the cabinet, a large, framed picture of the sheriff stands on the floor. To the side of the desk, there is a weird looking contraption: clearly, some sort of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a strange looking machine. On the opposite side of the room, two swinging doors lead back to town. Flash&apos;s empty dog food bowl is nailed to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

Muddy leans against the wall.

You can also see a deputy here.

His half-focused eyes drift from you to Pastor Pete and finally fix on Muddy who gives him a full-toothed (as many as Muddy still has, at any rate) grin.

The disoriented deputy asks, &quot;What? What in tarnation happened?&quot;

Muddy takes the initiative, &quot;I reckon you must&apos;ve drunk some potent firewater, deputy. You plumb passed out. Now, why don&apos;t you get up and let us out, we got work to do -- just like it says on that federal warrant.&quot;

The dull-witted deputy, still stunned by the recent turn of events stares at the warrant.

Muddy leans forward and points out, &quot;Down there, near the bottom. It says that we should be discharged to hang up the sheriff&apos;s portrait, don&apos;t it?&quot;

The deputy yawns and rubs his eyes, &quot;I reckon it do. But I thought you was criminals.&quot;

&quot;Oh shucks, no, deputy.&quot; Muddy puts on his most endearing smile. &quot;Don&apos;t you remember the sheriff asking you to take care of his guests? We were just staying here overnight. Now, why don&apos;t you let us out? The sheriff&apos;s going to be mad at us all if that picture ain&apos;t hung by morning.&quot;

The deputy reaches down and does something arcane to the lock. You don&apos;t quite see what he did, but it clicks open. He slumps wearily against the jail bars and the gate swings open, permitting passage eastward into the office.

One foot was bad enough, but two is more than the old dog can handle.

The deputy thunders, &quot;What the hoot-hollering blazes is the matter here?&quot; The deputy surveys the office quickly and then rattles the gate to make sure it is still locked. In his drunk rage, he doesn&apos;t notice the missing metal bar. 

&quot;Dumb dog,&quot; he mumbles, &quot;I was doing important business.&quot; He looks around for Flash, but the dog has already slid out of the office. The deputy shakes his head in frustration and leaves the office.

The deputy brightens. &quot;Ummm. I do smell me some coffee.&quot; The deputy drains the mug with a single gulp. &quot;That&apos;s good. I got to wake me up some.&quot;

Almost immediately, the deputy spins on his heel and drops to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

And into this fray, the unwholesome BEAST shall arise and the earth shall tremble. Its body shall tower above like a mountain, and upon the body shall be nineteen heads, each like unto a serpent. Upon each head, twelve horns, like that of the ram, the bull, and the elephant, say four of each. And upon each horn, sixteen stalks, not unlike celery in some respects, yet more flexible, more like the arms of an octopus, except being twice as numerous. And upon each stalk, eighty eyes, or forty pairs of eyes, if you prefer!&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t rightly know. Just something I do. Same way as I know there&apos;s 69,105 railroad ties between here and Muskogee. Ma said I was some kind of idiot savage.&quot;

Dumbfounded, you stop reading halfway through the pamphlet to stare incredulously at Muddy, who picks his nose. &quot;Yeah, go on. What else&apos;s it say?&quot;

&quot;Well let&apos;s see. It keeps going on like that for a ways without really saying much. By and by there&apos;s this part about a revival meeting. Some kind of doxology works, but out in the open, like under a circus tent. It says they&apos;ll be some preaching, some healing and even some dancing.

The ameoba-like mass of fat and fur known to you as Flash leaps immediately to his feet, saliva dripping from his toothless jowls. He lunges like a champion fencer for his food bowl. His leash snaps taut, pulling the lever away from the front door and towards the strange machine.

The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee pervades the office.

Finding no food in his bowl, Flash huffs perfunctorily and resumes his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

Muddy leans towards you, his face barely an inch from your ear and his buzzard-worthy breath even less so from your nose. &quot;Okay, Rick, I&apos;m a-going to tell my plan.&quot; Muddy pauses dramatically. &quot;Here it is: we got to break out of this jail before we get strunged up.&quot;

&quot;That&apos;s it? That&apos;s your whole damn plan? That don&apos;t count as no plan!&quot; you fume.

&quot;Keep it down, Rick!&quot; Muddy&apos;s gaze darts between the deputy and your third cellmate. &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s it for now. It takes time to cook up a good plan. You need lots of ingredients.&quot;

&quot;Muddy Charlie,&quot; you retort, &quot;I heared you was the worst cook in the Confederate Army. Your cooking like as did more damage than Sherman&apos;s March.&quot;

Muddy gives you a hurt look and sulks in the corner. After a while, you regret being so quick-tempered with your old buddy.

The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A broken stool lies on the floor.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

In the office you can see Flash.
