As the sun sets on the plains, Sheriff Cheney angrily snaps on the cuffs. You are shoved into the coach and land on top of Muddy Charlie and a pile of  silver dollars, which until recently had been the property of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Line.

Muddy whispers, &quot;Don&apos;t fret none, Rick! You done good blowing up that tunnel -- I just didn&apos;t plan on the sheriff getting word ahead of time, is all. That were powerful bad luck.&quot;

The sheriff climbs onto his horse, spits, and you begin to rumble forward. &quot;You boys really got it coming this time,&quot; he yells back cheerfully.

Muddy shakes his head. &quot;No offense, Sheriff, but I reckon you got the wrong men. We was just on our way to the theater.&quot;

The sheriff disagrees. &quot;The only place you boys are heading is straight to the...

    <result xml:space="preserve">In the twilight, you sight the sheriff&apos;s sturdy brick office near the edge of town. &quot;That&apos;s mighty fine construction,&quot; notes Muddy, sounding less feisty now. &quot;Mighty fine indeed.&quot; The coach rolls to a halt and a thick arm yanks you roughly from your seat. You land awkwardly in the rutted street, where the sheriff holds you in place with the heel of one boot. He yells to his men, &quot;Bring the coach around back, we got to impound that evidence.&quot; You are shoved into the sheriff&apos;s office and then into a small holding cell.

The deputy wakes with a start, whips his dusty boots off the desk and stands, tucking his shirt back into his pants. The sheriff gives him a brief, judgmental glance and offhandedly tosses an arrest warrant on the desk. He barks, &quot;Jimbo, listen up. Picked up these two down near the train. A federal marshal will be coming for them at eight o&apos;clock tomorrow morning. There&apos;s going to be a hanging!&quot; The deputy nods slowly. The sheriff continues, &quot;Please take care of our &apos;guests&apos;. I got to head down to Wichita Falls to discuss my invention with some investors, so you is in charge.&quot; The deputy smiles until the sheriff adds, &quot;Jimbo, don&apos;t screw up,&quot; as he heads out the door.

Jail Cell
Why are you not surprised to have landed right back in the hoosegow after another one of Muddy&apos;s dubious plans? Will you ever learn? How did it come to this? 

The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A broken stool lies on the floor.

Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the doorway, tempted by the dinner bell.

The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog&apos;s bowl, and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office&apos;s strange-looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

&quot;This here&apos;s Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don&apos;t cross him.&quot; Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close, and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof.

Jail Cell
The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A repaired stool stands upright.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon) and a hunk of meat here.

A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the jail bars.

In the office you can also see Flash.

The amoeba-like mass of fat and fur known to you as Flash leaps immediately to his feet, saliva dripping from his toothless jowls. He lunges like a champion fencer for his food bowl. His leash snaps taut, pulling the lever away from the front door and towards the strange machine.

The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee pervades the office.

Finding no food in his bowl, Flash snorts perfunctorily and resumes his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

One foot was bad enough, but two is more than the old dog can handle. Trying not to sniff the air, Flash turns tail and breaks for the door, straining against his leash, which is tied to the steam pipe lever.

Flash reflexively jumps towards his feeding bowl, pulling the lever and somehow causing the machine to rattle and buzz. Finding no food, the despondent dog returns to his favorite place in front of the boiler, shutting off the coffee machine.

The Deputy slams through the swinging doors to the office, lurching to the side as he struggles to put his other leg into his pants. He is bare-chested and empty-handed, aside from a nearly empty bottle of whiskey.

The deputy thunders, &quot;What the cluster-chucking blazes is the matter here?&quot; The deputy surveys the office quickly and then rattles the gate to make sure it is still locked. In his drunken rage, he doesn&apos;t notice the missing metal bar. 

Satisfied that you haven&apos;t escaped, he pushes the lever back to the middle position and warns, &quot;I don&apos;t know what you were up to what made old Flash trigger-happy, but don&apos;t let it happen again.&quot;

&quot;Dumb dog,&quot; he mumbles, &quot;I was doing important business.&quot; The deputy checks the gate again and sets off again towards the door.

The deputy brightens. &quot;Ummm. I do smell me some coffee.&quot; The deputy drains the mug with a single gulp. &quot;That&apos;s good. I got to wake me up some.&quot;

The deputy looks at the two of you.  &quot;Enough is enough.  You jokers stay put, I&apos;ll be back again in a bit.&quot;

Flash slinks back to his spot near the boiler and lays down again.

You land awkwardly in the rutted street, where the sheriff holds you in place with the heel of one boot. He yells to his men, &quot;Bring the coach around back, we got to impound that evidence.&quot; You are shoved into the sheriff&apos;s office and then into a small holding cell.

The deputy wakes with a start, whips his dusty boots off the desk and stands, tucking his shirt back into his pants. The sheriff gives him a brief, judgmental glance and offhandedly tosses an arrest warrant on the desk. He barks, &quot;Jimbo, listen up. Picked up these two down near the train. A federal marshal will be coming for them at eight o&apos;clock tomorrow morning. There&apos;s going to be a hanging!&quot; The deputy nods slowly. The sheriff continues, &quot;Please take care of our &apos;guests&apos;.

Muddy leans towards you, his face barely an inch from your ear and his buzzard-worthy breath even less so from your nose. &quot;Okay, Rick, I&apos;m a-going to tell you my plan.&quot; Muddy pauses dramatically. &quot;Here it is: we got to break out of this jail before we get strunged up.&quot;

The deputy pokes his head back in the office and remarks, &quot;I&apos;ve about had enough of you characters. You can stew in your own juices here. I got important things to do over yonder in the saloon. But I reckon I would be dairy licked to leave you jokers alone.&quot;

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the doorway, tempted by the dinner bell.

The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog&apos;s bowl, and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office&apos;s strange-looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

&quot;This here&apos;s Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don&apos;t cross him.&quot; Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close, and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can hear that halfway across town, and if&apos;n I do hear it, then you&apos;ll have to deal with me *and* Flash.&quot; The deputy gives Flash one last pat on the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon.

The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A repaired stool stands upright.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon) and a hunk of meat here.

A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the jail bars.

The amoeba-like mass of fat and fur known to you as Flash leaps immediately to his feet, saliva dripping from his toothless jowls. He lunges like a champion fencer for his food bowl. His leash snaps taut, pulling the lever away from the front door and towards the strange machine.

The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee pervades the office.

Finding no food in his bowl, Flash snorts perfunctorily and resumes his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

Jail Cell
The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A repaired stool stands upright.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon) and a hunk of meat here.

A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the jail bars.

On the machine is a cup (in which is some coffee).

In the office you can also see Flash.

One foot was bad enough, but two is more than the old dog can handle. Trying not to sniff the air, Flash turns tail and breaks for the door, straining against his leash, which is tied to the steam pipe lever. The lever swings towards the door, and from the roof you hear the ear-splitting drone of a railway steam whistle.

The deputy thunders, &quot;What the saddle sore slapping blazes is the matter here?&quot; The deputy surveys the office quickly and then rattles the gate to make sure it is still locked. In his drunken rage, he doesn&apos;t notice the missing metal bar. 

Satisfied that you haven&apos;t escaped, he pushes the lever back to the middle position and warns, &quot;I don&apos;t know what you were up to what made old Flash trigger-happy, but don&apos;t let it happen again.&quot;

&quot;Dumb dog,&quot; he mumbles, &quot;I was doing important business.&quot; The deputy shakes his head in frustration and sets off again towards the door.

The deputy brightens. &quot;Ummm. I do smell me some coffee.&quot; The deputy drains the mug with a single gulp. &quot;That&apos;s good. I got to wake me up some.&quot;

The deputy looks at the two of you.  &quot;Enough is enough.  You jokers stay put, I&apos;ll be back again in a bit.&quot;

Flash slinks back to his spot near the boiler and lays down again.

The fugitives Mudlark Abercromby MacGyver alias &quot;Muddy Charlie,&quot; alias &quot;Mudshoe,&quot; alias &quot;Pensicola Thelma,&quot; and one Major Richard Carter, alias &quot;Gentleman Rick,&quot; alias &quot;Poor Richard,&quot; alias &quot;Gumball Ricky,&quot; both formerly of the Confederate States Army, having been implicated by observation and circumstance of innumerable delicta, dacoiteries, iniquities, infringements, infractions, and indeed immorality, as well as trangressions, trespassing and trainstopping, are considered deleterious and detrimental to the welfare of the State, and THEREFORE, ordered thereupon that a Mittimus be made out to keep them confined until such time as they be discharged for proper hanging -- It&apos;s signed by the General.&quot;

&quot;Mittimus?&quot;

&quot;I reckon it&apos;s after Thanksgiving, before Easter.&quot; 


Muddy gives you that familiar old look that always leads to trouble. &quot;I got me another cunning plan. C&apos;mon, ask your old buddy Muddy...&quot; Muddy leans forward, clearly impatient for you to ask him about his latest stroke of (in his opinion) genius.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah. I suppose. I didn&apos;t think of that.&quot; Muddy considers the matter. &quot;Maybe we could make one. If you can find something that I can use as a pen, I reckon we can squish something or other up to make some kind of ink for it.&quot;

The disoriented deputy asks, &quot;What? What in tarnation happened?&quot;

Muddy takes the initiative, &quot;I reckon you must&apos;ve drunk some potent firewater, deputy. You plumb passed out. Now, why don&apos;t you get up and let us out, we got work to do -- just like it says on that federal warrant.&quot;

The dull-witted deputy, still stunned by the recent turn of events, stares at the warrant.

Muddy leans forward and points out, &quot;Down there, near the bottom. It says that we should be discharged to hang up the sheriff&apos;s portrait, don&apos;t it?&quot;

The deputy yawns and rubs his eyes, &quot;I reckon it do. But I thought you was criminals.&quot;

&quot;Oh shucks, no, deputy.&quot; Muddy puts on his most endearing smile. &quot;Don&apos;t you remember the sheriff asking you to take care of his guests? We were just staying here overnight. Now, why don&apos;t you let us out? The sheriff&apos;s going to be mad at us all if that picture ain&apos;t hung by morning.&quot;

The deputy reaches down and does something arcane to the lock. You don&apos;t quite see what he did, but it clicks open. He slumps wearily against the jail bars, and the gate swings open, permitting passage eastward into the office.

Office
A one-room jailhouse is fitting for this jerkwater town. There&apos;s a big, wooden desk in the middle of the room. Just behind the desk is a fancy cabinet, with real glass in the door. Next to the cabinet, a large, framed picture of the sheriff stands on the floor. To the side of the desk, there is a weird-looking contraption: clearly, some sort of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a strange-looking machine. On the opposite side of the room, two swinging doors lead back to town; a small bell hangs on a hook attached to the door. Flash&apos;s empty dog food bowl is nailed to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

Muddy leans against the wall.

A dented food bowl sits on the office floor, only a few feet from the jail bars.

You can also see the deputy here.

A repaired stool stands upright.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

In the jail cell you can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon).

I also would guess that he will need some big-time investors to put a plan like this into action, but I don&apos;t see anything wrong with that. The sheriff&apos;s a businessman pure and simple. There isn&apos;t anything more American than a man willing to make a profit, when the profit is there for the taking.&quot;

The marshal advises, &quot;Citizens, I am required by federal law as it applies to the Territory to advise you that CAPITAL CHARGES have been filed against you, and summary execution will take place, unless evidence to the contrary can be brought to light.&quot;

    <result xml:space="preserve">You show the marshal the receipt and suggest that the sheriff is quite in debt, and might turn to illegal activities to pay it off. 

The marshal dispatches two guards to search behind the office, and when they return with corroboration about the stolen silver, the marshal instructs his guards to restrain and disarm the sheriff, concluding, &quot;So, now it is clear. The sheriff took advantage of the railway incident to rob the train&apos;s silver himself in order to finance the development of his invention into a business. He framed these two itinerant laborers to shift the blame. No wonder he wanted them killed so quickly.&quot;

The marshal rips the gold star off Sheriff Cheney&apos;s shirt and instructs the guards, &quot;Place Mr. Cheney behind bars.&quot;

disheveled man yawns and walks out of the cell as the guards wrestle the sheriff past him. &quot;I do reckon I slept like the dead last night. Thank you for a peaceful night, deputy,&quot; and he walks out the front door.

The marshal raises his eyebrows but continues, &quot;Deputy James Smith Bush, by the power invested in me as federal marshal of this district, I hereby promote you to Sheriff of the Town of Crawdad&apos;s Gulch. Congratulations.&quot; The newly appointed sheriff grins and shakes his hand. The marshal almost pins the star to Jimbo&apos;s bare chest, but stops short and just hands it to him. The marshal advises him, &quot;James, you&apos;ll probably want to get yourself some deputies -- men you can trust.&quot;

Sheriff Jim looks over to you and Muddy. The color drains from Muddy&apos;s face.

* Did you try chewing the tobacco and spitting at everything in sight? How &quot;bout old Flash?

* There are three ways of driving the deputy out of the jail, how many did you find?

* Did you try reading the initials engraved on the stool?  Repeatedly?

Some other random trivia:

* The game is set in the Indian Territory, which would later become the Oklahoma territory and subsequently the state. How many references can you find to the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;?

* In the real West, it wouldn&apos;t have made any sense to put beans in a can. They were a cheap staple, transported dry, likely in sacks.

* Boot spurs were referred to as &quot;can openers&quot; in the Old West. Really.

* The transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, but it crossed two states above Oklahoma. The first railroads in Oklahoma were built in 1870, and the state wasn&apos;t crossed until 1871.

* The espresso machine was invented in 1901 in Italy, but we figured that so many Old West movies came from Italy, that it would look natural enough in our story.

* The slang &quot;hoosegow&quot; comes from the Spanish juzgado, which was a type of judge tribunal.

Finally, if you&apos;ve read this far down the page, you deserve to know about the &quot;EASTER EGG&quot; command, which will reveal several alternate endings to the story. Explore them at your own risk.

Flash wakes with a start and sneezes loudly. The fur on his back bristles and he opens his eyes to stare in horror at your feet. He backs away, towards the front door. The leash pulls taut.

One foot was bad enough, but two is more than the old dog can handle. Trying not to sniff the air, Flash turns tail and breaks for the door, straining against his leash which is tied to the steam pipe lever. The lever swings towards the door, and from the roof you hear the ear-splitting drone of a railway steam whistle.

The Deputy slams through the swinging doors to the office, lurching to the side as he struggles to put his other leg into his pants. He is bare-chested and empty-handed, aside from a nearly empty bottle of whiskey. Flash is so scared that yanks the leash and snaps the lever clear off the machine.

The deputy thunders, &quot;What the hoot-hollering blazes is the matter here?&quot; The deputy surveys the office quickly and then rattles the gate to make sure it is still locked. In his drunk rage, he doesn&apos;t notice the missing metal bar. 

&quot;Dumb dog,&quot; he mumbles, &quot;I was doing important business.&quot; He looks around for Flash, but the dog has already slid out of the office. The deputy waves his fist at you and turns to leave the office.

The deputy brightens. &quot;Ummm. I do smell me some coffee.&quot; The deputy drains the mug with a single gulp. &quot;That&apos;s good. I got to wake me up some.&quot;

Almost immediately, the deputy spins on his heel and drops to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

&quot;For lo, the impetuous and retributive spirit of FINAL JUDGEMENT is stirring in the heart of the unfaithful, and a FIERY thunderhead of retribution is gathering across the plains of the undeserving, the bereft of propriety, and promulgators of heresy, and the scalding hot sparks of TRUTH are spraying forth, catching light the arid and HIGHLY FLAMMABLE and veritably kerosene-soaked sawdust of the weak-willed. And into this fray, the unwholesome BEAST shall arise and the earth shall tremble. Its body shall tower above like a mountain, and upon the body shall be nineteen heads, each like unto a serpent. Upon each head, twelve horns, like that of the ram, the bull, and the elephant, say four of each. And upon each horn, sixteen stalks, not unlike celery in some respects, yet more flexible, more like the arms of an octopus, except being twice as numerous. And upon each stalk, eighty eyes, or forty pairs of eyes, if you prefer!&quot;


Muddy, who had been staring intently at his boot tips, looks up, eye brows knit in concentration. &quot;I don&apos;t get it. Why would anything need two hundred ninety-one thousand, eight hundred and forty eyes?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; you remark, looking up from the pamphlet. &quot;Are you kidding me? How could you figure that out?&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t rightly know. Just something I do. Same way as I know there&apos;s 69,105 railroad ties between here and Muskogee. Ma said I was some kind of idiot savage.&quot;

The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee pervades the office.

Finding no food in his bowl, Flash huffs perfunctorily and resumes his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

The deputy looks up from the warrant, annoyed at the distraction. &quot;Them jail bars is solid iron, boys. Now stop messing with them. I would surely hate to have to shoot you tonight and ruin tomorrow&apos;s hanging.&quot;

The deputy rubs his head with his palms and growls, &quot;I&apos;m a-warning you first instead of a-shooting you first because I got myself a bad headache and I don&apos;t need the extra noise. Keep messing with them jail bars and I will scratch my itchy trigger finger.&quot;

Muddy raises his eyebrows at you to get your attention and whispers, &quot;He ain&apos;t kidding, Rick. We best not push him too far. He&apos;s  a rattlesnake in a bottle of tequila.&quot;

Without bothering to get up from his comfortable position behind the desk, the deputy draws his mean-looking nine-shot LeMat revolver and squeezes off a lazy shot in your direction, only looking afterwards to see if he hit anything. &quot;I said, stop messing around in there, or the vultures are going to dine early tonight.&quot;

Muddy shakes his head, motioning you back. &quot;Rick, this guy&apos;s one stagecoach stop short of the fort, if you know what I mean. We best to find a way to get him out of the picture, or we ain&apos;t never going to get out of here.&quot;

The deputy rolls his eyes, &quot;You is about the dumbest, stupidist, most corn-starched spit-lickingest idiotic pie-brained goat-galooting criminals I did ever see.&quot;

He pulls his gun out from under the desk and uses it for punctuation, mainly of the ceiling. &quot;Listen, you!&quot; (Bang.) &quot;When I said--&quot; (bang) &quot;--don&apos;t--&quot; (bang) &quot;--go messing--&quot; (bang) &quot;--with stuff--&quot; (bang) &quot;--I meant it.&quot; (Bang, bang.) &quot;Now, do you understand me-- &quot; (bang). The last bang rises slightly in pitch to convey that it was a question.

The bullets ricocheting off the jailhouse walls every which way are enough to shake up even Muddy, who hisses, &quot;Stop messing with him Rick, the clock&apos;s ticking and we got to get out here by morning, or we&apos;ll be wearing hemp neckties for the rest of our lives. Rick, you got to figure us a way to get him out of here, so we can get busy with some proper jail-breaking.&quot;

The deputy leaps up, this time angry, his face flushing. He stuffs the paper in his pocket and levels his gun at your head. &quot;I had enough of you! (click)&quot; He stares stupidly at his gun before realizing that he has to reload it. &quot;Lucky for you, I reckon.&quot; He begins plucking bullets from his belt and loading them one by one into the cylinder. &quot;You so much as sing, and I&apos;ll have to see to your killing.&quot;

A look of fear washes over Muddy&apos;s face, &quot;Don&apos;t do it, Rick. Don&apos;t do it.&quot;

&quot;I declare: that&apos;s just the worst thing I ever heard in my life. It&apos;s enough to drive a man to drink.&quot; To prove it, he takes a mighty swig from the whiskey bottle and wipes his mouth with the back of his sleeve. The deputy puts his fingers in his ears and tries to ignore you.

You keep playing.

The deputy balls his hands into fists and trembles with annoyance, &quot;I&apos;m going to the saloon to listen to some real music, from some real talented lady folk of the female persuasion.&quot; The deputy walks out the front door in a huff.

&quot;You should hear me play piano,&quot; you remark, but he&apos;s already out of earshot.

[Your score has just gone up by one]

Muddy says, &quot;Nice one.  Hey -- I reckon I saw that screw up there wiggle a bit when you played the harmonica. I didn&apos;t say nothing on account what the deputy was here.&quot;  He points to a screw holding in one of the cell bars.

A fly buzzes past your ear and lands on the ceiling.

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the door way, tempted by the dinner bell.

The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog&apos;s bowl and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office&apos;s strange looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

&quot;This here&apos;s Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don&apos;t cross him.&quot; Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can hear that half way across town, and if&apos;n I do hear it, then you&apos;ll have to deal with me *and* Flash.&quot; The deputy gives Flash one last pat on the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon.

The Deputy&apos;s cigar seems to shrivel and hang limply in his mouth, as its prodigious odor is astronomically outclassed by the combined stench of your two feet.
