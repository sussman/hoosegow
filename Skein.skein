As the sun sets on the plains, Sheriff Cheney angrily snaps on the cuffs. You are shoved into the coach and land on top of Muddy Charlie and a pile of  silver dollars, which until recently had been the property of the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Line.

Muddy whispers, &quot;Don&apos;t fret none, Rick! You done good blowing up that tunnel -- I just didn&apos;t plan on the sheriff getting word ahead of time, is all. That were powerful bad luck.&quot;

The sheriff climbs onto his horse, spits, and you begin to rumble forward. &quot;You boys really got it coming this time,&quot; he yells back cheerfully.

Muddy shakes his head. &quot;No offense, Sheriff, but I reckon you got the wrong men. We was just on our way to the theater.&quot;

The sheriff disagrees. &quot;The only place you boys are heading is straight to the...

You land awkwardly in the rutted street, where the sheriff holds you in place with the heel of one boot. He yells to his men, &quot;Bring the coach around back, we got to impound that evidence.&quot; You are shoved into the sheriff&apos;s office and then into a small holding cell.

The deputy wakes with a start, whips his dusty boots off the desk and stands, tucking his shirt back into his pants. The sheriff gives him a brief, judgmental glance and offhandedly tosses an arrest warrant on the desk. He barks, &quot;Jimbo, listen up. Picked up these two down near the train. A federal marshal will be coming for them at eight o&apos;clock tomorrow morning. There&apos;s going to be a hanging!&quot;. The deputy nods slowly. The sheriff continues, &quot;Please take care of our &apos;guests&apos;. I got to head down to Wichita Falls to discuss my invention with some investors, so you is in charge.&quot; The deputy smiles until the sheriff adds, &quot;Jimbo, don&apos;t screw up,&quot; as he heads out the door.

Jail Cell
Why are you not surprised to have landed right back in the hoosegow after another one of Muddy&apos;s dubious plans? Will you ever learn? You weren&apos;t brought up for this sort of life -- how did it come to this? 

The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A broken stool lies on the floor.

Muddy leans against the wall tapping a harmonica on his arm.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

The deputy pokes his head back in the office and remarks, &quot;I&apos;ve about had enough of you characters. You can stew in your own juices here. I got important things to do over yonder in the saloon. But I reckon I would be dairy licked to leave you jokers alone.&quot;

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the door way, tempted by the dinner bell.

The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog&apos;s bowl and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office&apos;s strange looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

&quot;This here&apos;s Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don&apos;t cross him.&quot; Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can hear that half way across town, and if&apos;n I do hear it, then you&apos;ll have to deal with me *and* Flash.&quot; The deputy gives Flash one last pat on the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon.

You flip the stool over and wiggle the hollow gray tube into the empty socket. It fits perfectly and remains in place when you let go of the bar, but you think you could yank the gray bar out again if you needed it. You now have a stool with three even legs: two wood, one metal.

Jail Cell (on the stool)
The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon) and a hunk of meat here.

The ameoba-like mass of fat and fur known to you as Flash leaps immediately to his feet, saliva dripping from his toothless jowls. He lunges like a champion fencer for his food bowl. His leash snaps taut, pulling the lever away from the front door and towards the strange machine.

The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee pervades the office.

Finding no food in his bowl, Flash huffs perfunctorily and resumes his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

Jail Cell
The small jail cell is brick on three sides, metal bars on the other, with a tightly locked gate. A small window is set into the brickwork above your head. Through the jail bars you can see the sheriff&apos;s office.

A repaired stool stands upright.

Muddy leans against the wall.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

You can also see a can of beans (in which is a spoon) here.

In the office you can see a deputy.

Sheridan of Fort Sill, the Indian Territory of these United States of America. The fugitives Mudlark Abercromby MacGyver alias &quot;Muddy,&quot; alias &quot;Mudshoe,&quot; alias &quot;Pensicola Thelma,&quot; and one Major Richard Carter, alias &quot;Gentleman Rick,&quot; alias &quot;Poor Richard,&quot; alias &quot;Gumball Ricky,&quot; both formerly of the Confederate States Army, having been implicated by observation and circumstance of innumerable delicta, dacoiteries, iniquities, infringements, infractions, and indeed immorality, as well as trangressions, trespassing and trainstopping, are considered deleterious and detrimental to the welfare of the State, and THEREFORE, ordered thereupon that a Mittimus be made out to keep them confined until such time as they be discharged for proper hanging -- It&apos;s signed by the General.&quot;

&quot;Mittimus?&quot;

&quot;I reckon it&apos;s after Thanksgiving, before Easter.&quot; 


Muddy gives you that familiar old look that always leads to trouble. &quot;I got me another cunning plan. C&apos;mon, ask your old buddy Muddy...&quot; Muddy leans forward, clearly impatient for you to ask him about his latest stroke of (in his opinion) genius.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah. I suppose. I didn&apos;t think of that.&quot; Muddy considers the matter. &quot;Maybe we could make one. If you can find something that I can use as a pen, I reckon that one of them red berries would make a right proper kind of ink for it.&quot;

Muddy takes the initiative, &quot;I reckon you must&apos;ve drunk some potent firewater, deputy. You plumb passed out. Now, why don&apos;t you get up and let us out, we got work to do -- just like it says on that federal warrant.&quot;

The dull-witted deputy, still stunned by the recent turn of events stares at the warrant.

Muddy leans forward and points out, &quot;Down there, near the bottom. It says that we should be discharged to hang up the sheriff&apos;s portrait, don&apos;t it?&quot;

The deputy yawns and rubs his eyes, &quot;I reckon it do. But I thought you was criminals.&quot;

&quot;Oh shucks, no, deputy.&quot; Muddy puts on his most endearing smile. &quot;Don&apos;t you remember the sheriff asking you to take care of his guests? We were just staying here overnight.

Office
A one room jailhouse is fitting for this jerkwater town. There&apos;s a big, wooden desk in the middle of the room, and behind it sits the deputy. Just behind the desk is a fancy cabinet, with real glass in the door. Next to the cabinet, a large, framed picture of the sheriff stands on the floor. To the side of the desk, there is a weird looking contraption: clearly, some sort of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a strange looking machine. On the opposite side of the room, two swinging doors lead back to town. Flash&apos;s empty dog food bowl is nailed to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

Muddy leans against the wall.

You can also see a deputy here.

A repaired stool stands upright.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

In the jail cell you can also see a harmonica and a can of beans (in which is a spoon).

Despite the distortion, you see what looks like a gun belt some kind of shiny yellow object. Maybe gold, you think, hopefully.

There&apos;s a big, wooden desk in the middle of the room, and behind it sits the deputy. Just behind the desk is a fancy cabinet, with real glass in the door. Next to the cabinet, a large, framed picture of the sheriff stands on the floor. To the side of the desk, there is a weird looking contraption: clearly, some sort of steam boiler which is connected by pipes to a strange looking machine. On the opposite side of the room, two swinging doors lead back to town. Flash&apos;s empty dog food bowl is nailed to the floor just in front of your jail cell.

Muddy leans against the wall.

You can also see a deputy here.

A repaired stool stands upright.

In the corner of the cell, a disheveled man in a black suit is stretched out on a crude wooden bench and is snoring loudly, oblivious to your presence.

In the jail cell you can also see a harmonica and a can of beans (in which is a spoon).

Sheriff Cheney surges forward pointing his finger at you and Muddy, &quot;It were these two what blown up that train tunnel! They&apos;s escaping when we walked in! Look, they done killed my deputy! We should drop &apos;em where they stand.&quot;

The marshal looks uncertain and waves the army guards forward, training their pistols on you. 

He rests his hand on the sheriff&apos;s trigger arm and says, &quot;Sheriff, without any evidence to substantiate your accusation regarding the train robbery, I was reluctant to see these men hanged without a trial. Given the corpse of a lawman in front of us, though, even I have to agree that justice should be swift and definitive in this instance.&quot;

The disoriented deputy asks, &quot;What? What in tarnation happened?&quot;

Muddy takes the initiative, &quot;I reckon you must&apos;ve drunk some potent firewater, deputy. You plumb passed out. Now, why don&apos;t you get up and let us out, we got work to do -- just like it says on that federal warrant.&quot;

The dull-witted deputy, still stunned by the recent turn of events stares at the warrant.

Muddy leans forward and points out, &quot;Down there, near the bottom. It says that we should be discharged to hang up the sheriff&apos;s portrait, don&apos;t it?&quot;

The deputy yawns and rubs his eyes, &quot;I reckon it do. But I thought you was criminals.&quot;

&quot;Oh shucks, no, deputy.&quot; Muddy puts on his most endearing smile. &quot;Don&apos;t you remember the sheriff asking you to take care of his guests? We were just staying here overnight. Now, why don&apos;t you let us out? The sheriff&apos;s going to be mad at us all if that picture ain&apos;t hung by morning.&quot;

The deputy reaches down and does something arcane to the lock. You don&apos;t quite see what he did, but it clicks open. He slumps wearily against the jail bars and the gate swings open, permitting passage eastward into the office.

Muddy whispers, &quot;Rick, we ain&apos;t got long. I reckon that marshal is someone what can be reasoned with.&quot;

I also would guess that he will need some big-time investors to put a plan like this into action, but I don&apos;t see anything wrong with that. The sheriff&apos;s a businessman pure and simple. There isn&apos;t anything more American than a man willing to make a profit, when the profit is there for the taking.&quot;

The marshal advises, &quot;Citizens, I am required by federal law as it applies to the Territory to advise you that CAPITAL CHARGES have been filed against you, and summary execution will take place, unless evidence to the contrary can be brought to light.&quot;

The sheriff rolls his eyes, &quot;For the sake of the all that&apos;s Holy, whyn&apos;t we shoot &apos;em dead right here?&quot;

The marshal dispatches two guards to search behind the office, and when they return with corroboration about the stolen silver, the marshal instructs his guards to restrain and disarm the sheriff, concluding, &quot;So, now it is clear. The sheriff took advantage of the railway incident to rob the train&apos;s silver himself in order to finance the development of his invention into a business. He framed these two itinerant laborers to shift the blame. No wonder he wanted them killed so quickly.&quot;

The marshal rips the gold star off the Sheriff Cheney&apos;s shirt and instructs the guards, &quot;Place Mr. Cheney behind bars.&quot;

Pastor Pete yawns and walks out of the cell as the guards wrestle the sheriff past him. &quot;I do reckon I slept like the dead last night. Thank you for a peaceful night, deputy,&quot; and he walks out the front door.

The marshal raises his eyebrows, but continues, &quot;Deputy James Smith Bush, by the power invested in me as federal marshal of this district, I hereby promote you to Sheriff of the Town of Crawdad&apos;s Gulch. Congratulations.&quot; The newly appointed sheriff grins and shakes his hand. As the marshal pins the star on Jimbo&apos;s chest he advises, &quot;James, you&apos;ll probably want to get yourself some deputies -- men you can trust.&quot;

Sheriff Jim looks over to you and Muddy. The color drains from Muddy&apos;s face.

* Did you try chewing the tobacco and spitting at everything in sight? How &quot;bout old Flash?

* There are three ways of driving the deputy out of the jail, how many did you find?

* Did you try reading the initials engraved on the stool?  Repeatedly?

Some other random trivia:

* The game is set in the Indian Territory, which would later become the Oklahoma territory and subsequently the state. How many references can you find to the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;?

* In the real West, it wouldn&apos;t have made any sense to put beans in a can. They were a cheap staple, transported dry, likely in sacks.

* Boot spurs were referred to as &quot;can openers&quot; in the Old West. Really.

* The transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, but it crossed two states above Oklahoma. The first railroads in Oklahoma were built in 1870, and the state wasn&apos;t crossed until 1871.

* The espresso machine was invented in 1901 in Italy, but we figured that so many Old West movies came from Italy, that it would look natural enough in our story.

* The slang &quot;hoosegow&quot; comes from the Spanish juzgado, which was a judges&quot; tribunal.

Finally, if you&apos;ve read this far down the page, you deserve to know about the &quot;EASTER EGG&quot; command, which will reveal several alternate endings to the story. Explore them at your own risk.

&quot;The Prairie Gospel Church of Uncanny Righteousness&quot;

&quot;For lo, the impetuous and retributive spirit of FINAL JUDGEMENT is stirring in the heart of the unfaithful, and a FIERY thunderhead of retribution is gathering across the plains of the undeserving, the bereft of propriety, and promulgators of heresy, and the scalding hot sparks of TRUTH are spraying forth, catching light the arid and HIGHLY FLAMMABLE and veritably kerosene-soaked sawdust of the weak-willed. And into this fray, the unwholesome BEAST shall arise and the earth shall tremble. Its body shall tower above like a mountain, and upon the body shall be nineteen heads, each like unto a serpent. Upon each head, twelve horns, like that of the ram, the bull, and the elephant, say four of each. And upon each horn, sixteen stalks, not unlike celery in some respects, yet more flexible, more like the arms of an octopus, except being twice as numerous. And upon each stalk, eighty eyes, or forty pairs of eyes, if you prefer!&quot;


Muddy, who had been staring intently at his boot tips, looks up, eye brows knit in concentration. &quot;I don&apos;t get it. Why would anything need two hundred ninety-one thousand, eight hundred and forty eyes?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; you remark, looking up from the pamphlet. &quot;Are you kidding me? How could you figure that out?&quot;

&quot;Don&apos;t rightly know. Just something I do. Same way as I know there&apos;s 69,105 railroad ties between here and Muskogee. Ma said I was some kind of idiot savage.&quot;

Dumbfounded, you stop reading halfway through the pamphlet to stare incredulously at Muddy, who picks his nose. &quot;Yeah, go on. What else&apos;s it say?&quot;

The ameoba-like mass of fat and fur known to you as Flash leaps immediately to his feet, saliva dripping from his toothless jowls. He lunges like a champion fencer for his food bowl. His leash snaps taut, pulling the lever away from the front door and towards the strange machine.

The boiler hisses and gurgles, steam jets from the rivet joints in the pipe that connects to the machine, and the machine itself vibrates and rumbles for a minute. A white cup drops from a chute and brown liquid squirts from a nozzle and fills the cup. The smell of fresh coffee pervades the office.

Finding no food in his bowl, Flash huffs perfunctorily and resumes his former position, pulling the lever back to the middle position.

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the door way, tempted by the dinner bell.

The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog&apos;s bowl and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office&apos;s strange looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

&quot;This here&apos;s Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don&apos;t cross him.&quot; Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can hear that half way across town, and if&apos;n I do hear it, then you&apos;ll have to deal with me *and* Flash.&quot; The deputy gives Flash one last pat on the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon.

Muddy&apos;s eyes water as he complains, &quot;Ain&apos;t you got no sense of smell in that head of yours?&quot;

To which you reply, &quot;Not after I been downwind of you around feeding time, nope. This ain&apos;t nothing next to what you can do with a can of beans!&quot;

The deputy wrinkles his nose in distaste and produces a fat cigar from his pocket. He reaches over to the office&apos;s steam boiler, lights the cigar, walks right up to the jail bars and blows the smoke directly into your face. The stench of the cigar is evenly matched against the reek of your feet.

Muddy&apos;s eyes water as he complains, &quot;Not again! My poor nose!&quot;

The Deputy&apos;s cigar seems to shrivel and hang limply in his mouth, as its prodigious odor is astronomically outclassed by the combined stench of your two feet. Suppressing the urge to throw up from the smell, the deputy reaches over to the whiskey bottle and half drains it on his way out the door.

After he leaves, you give in to Muddy&apos;s desperate pleas to put your boots back on.

The fragrance gradually improves as the universe cools.

The deputy pokes his head back in the office and remarks, &quot;I&apos;ve about had enough of you characters. You can stew in your own juices here. I got important things to do over yonder in the saloon. But I reckon I would be dairy licked to leave you jokers alone.&quot;

The deputy grabs a dinner bell from the hook where it hangs next to the office door, and he rings the bell slowly a few times. Nothing happens. He rings it again. Minutes go by and the deputy waits impatiently. Finally, a fat bloodhound waddles leisurely through the door way, tempted by the dinner bell.

The deputy reaches into his pocket and retrieves a scrap of beef jerky. He pitches it into the dog&apos;s bowl and the bloodhound gobbles it down. The deputy leads his mangy old dog towards the office&apos;s strange looking steam boiler and ties him to it with a leash.

&quot;This here&apos;s Flash, my hunting dog. I got to warn you that he can be vicious when he gets riled up, so don&apos;t cross him.&quot; Flash slowly slumps down next to the boiler, enjoying the heat. His heavy eyes close and drool drips from his toothless mouth.

&quot;Flash here&apos;s apt to rip your throat out if you so much as look at him funny, but I got him hooked up here to the sheriff&apos;s fancy steam contraption.&quot; The deputy narrows his eyes distrustfully. &quot;If you boys were so stupid as to make for the jailhouse door, &apos;ol Flash would yank that lever and set off the steam whistle on the roof. The sheriff installed it special for me, so as I can come when he wants me. I can hear that half way across town, and if&apos;n I do hear it, then you&apos;ll have to deal with me *and* Flash.&quot; The deputy gives Flash one last pat on the head, swigs the whiskey one more time, and departs for the saloon.
